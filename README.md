# Testing for Add Remove function in To Do List App 

- Jest framework is used  for testing.
- Created  (addremove.test.js) for a file containing the add item and delete item functions that you want to test.
- Tests are written for pure functions. Some of those functions however will update localStorage and manipulate the DOM. For those, mocks are used. 
- A storage object is mocked  to "imitate" localStorage operations.
- HTML is mocked  to test if add/delete functions add or remove exactly one  element to/from the list in the DOM.
- describe() method is used. 
- function for editing the task description.
- function for updating an item's 'completed' status.
- the "Clear all completed" function.
- group tests using the describe() method.
