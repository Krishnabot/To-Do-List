# To Do List Minimalist App 

- New project is set up with webpack.
- index.html is created  and all  HTML markup  was written there.
- An empty To Do List placeholder was created.
- The index.html file is  set as a template using the HTML Webpack Plugin.
- Removed all hardcoded items from the tasks array.
- Created a new JavaScript file for the new functionality.
- Implemented a function for adding a new task. 
- Implement a function for deleting a task.
- Implement a function for editing task descriptions.
- new tasks have the property completed set to false and the property index set to the value of the new array length. 
- Deleting a task updates all remaining items' indexes, so they represent the current list order and are unique. 
- All changes to the To-Do List should be saved in local storage.
- it contains methods related to the status updates (completed: true / false).
- An event listener is added  to the checkbox.
- Items object's value for completed key is updated upon user actions.
- Function for the "Clear all completed" button is implemented using filter() method.
- The he updated array of items is stored  in local storage, so the user gets the correct list values after the page reloads.
